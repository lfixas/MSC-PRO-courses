## How Great Leaders Inspire Action

Great leaders think, act, and communicate the same way:

### The Golden Circle:
1. **Why** (🔥🔥🔥) 
2. **How** (🔥🔥)
3. **What** (🔥)

The key is not *what* we do but **why** we do it.  

### Examples of Communication:
❌ *We make great computers, user-friendly. Why? 🤷‍♂️*  
➡️ This doesn't inspire people to buy.

✅ *Everything we do is driven by a belief: we think differently, we prioritize user-friendliness, and that’s why we make great computers.*  
➡️ This approach naturally attracts people who share the same vision.

### The Power of "Why":
- The goal is not to sell a product but to attract people who **believe in what we believe**.
- The best employees and partners are those who are driven by the same cause, not just by money.
- True leaders are **driven by a cause, a dream**, not by the pursuit of wealth or fame.

### Mass Market Success:
- Reaching **13.5%** of the population (innovators + early adopters) is critical.
- These people influence the majority and are willing to **wait 16 hours in line** to be the first to get something they believe in.
- If we only communicate *what* we sell, we won't inspire people to believe in it.

### The Effect of Belief:
- Early adopters become **living proof** that the product is great.
- **"I believe" → others believe → it attracts those who want to believe too.**

## How to Make Hard Choices

Choices always involve **something that matters to us**.

### What is a Hard Choice?
- Two options that are better in some ways, but **neither is objectively superior**.
- Hard choices are difficult because **we don’t know which one is better**.
- We tend to pick the **safer** option.

### There Is No "Best" Option:
- If two options were **truly equal**, we could flip a coin.  
- But in reality, they aren’t. We cannot **scientifically quantify** such decisions.
- **Values cannot be measured like scientific data.**

### Why Hard Choices Matter:
- If every decision were easy, we would be **enslaved by pure reason**.
- Hard choices give us the **power to create our own reasons**.
- **This makes us the authors of our own lives.** 💡
